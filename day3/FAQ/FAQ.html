            <div class="FAQ_1">1.What is HTML and what is it used for?  <div class="arrow" id="arrow"><span></span></div></div>
            <div id="toggle_1"><p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard language used 
                to create and design web pages and web applications. It provides the structure for web 
                content by using a system of tags and attributes to define elements like headings, paragraphs, 
                links, images, and other types of content. HTML forms the backbone of web pages, allowing browsers 
                to display and organize content in a readable format.</p>

            <div class="FAQ_2">2.What is the difference between baking powder and baking soda?<div class="arrow_2" id="arrow_2"></div></div>
            <div id="toggle_2"><p>Baking powder and baking soda are both leavening agents used 
                    in baking, but they work differently. Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) requires 
                    an acid, like lemon juice or vinegar, to activate it and produce carbon dioxide, 
                    which helps dough rise. Baking powder contains baking soda along with an acidifying 
                    agent and a drying agent (usually cornstarch), so it only needs moisture to activate 
                    and release carbon dioxide. Baking powder can be single-acting (activated by moisture) 
                    or double-acting (activated by moisture and heat), providing more leavening power.</p>

            <div class="FAQ_3">3.What are the essential components of a gaming PC??<div class="arrow_3" id="arrow_3"></div></div>
             <div id="toggle_3"><p>A gaming PC requires several key components to ensure a smooth and 
                immersive gaming experience. The essential components include: a powerful CPU (Central Processing Unit) 
                to handle game processes and multitasking; a high-performance GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) 
                for rendering graphics and achieving high frame rates; sufficient RAM (Random Access Memory) 
                to support fast and efficient data processing; and a fast SSD (Solid State Drive) for quicker 
                load times and storage. Additionally, a reliable motherboard, an efficient cooling system, and 
                a quality power supply unit (PSU) are crucial for maintaining system stability and performance. 
                Itâ€™s also beneficial to have a high-resolution monitor and a responsive gaming mouse and keyboard 
                to enhance gameplay.</p></div>
